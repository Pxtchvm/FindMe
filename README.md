# FindMe: School Lost and Found System

A web-based Lost and Found Management System for Mapua University Makati that streamlines the process of logging, tracking, and claiming lost items on campus.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

At Mapua University Makati, students and staff frequently lose personal items on campus, such as ID cards, gadgets, books, and bags. The current manual process for handling lost-and-found items is inefficient and time-consuming, often leading to unclaimed items and frustrated students. Lost items may sit unrecorded, misplaced, or never reach their owners due to the lack of a proper system for reporting and tracking.
